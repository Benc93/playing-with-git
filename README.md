##Pre-course exercise: Playing with Git  

####Summary of Activity  
    
This was one of the first pre-course exercises whose purpose it was to introduce us to GitHub, and it's interaction with the command line. It's not an enormous repository as you can see (!). This was just getting my feet wet with GitHub:  
+ Registering a GitHub account.   
+ Installing Git on the local repository. 
+ Setting up of a new GitHub Repository, and initializing Git with that repository locally.   
+ Passing a small text file from the local repository up to the GitHub repository using the Git commands in the terminal. 
    
####Lessons Learned     
   
It's tough to really take many lessons away from something that feels now like very simple work that has almost become second nature. Except to say - at the time I remember that the concepts and the steps in this exercise were utterly alien, and I'm encouraged by looking back at this work in helping me put into context the progress I've made in what is a reasonably short amount of time.
